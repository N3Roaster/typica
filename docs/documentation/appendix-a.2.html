				<h1>Appendix A.2: Hardware Compatibility Notes - National Instruments NI USB-9211A</h1>
				<p>NI USB-9211 is the model name for a National Instruments NI 9211 module paired with an NI USB-9162 Hi-Speed USB Carrier. National Instruments has many combinations of the NI 9211 module with other devices featuring very similar model names and different software compatability. Please check carefully.</p>
				<p>This hardware is known to work with Microsoft Windows. Typica can use <em>either</em> NI-DAQmx Base 3.6 <em>or</em> NI DAQmx 9.6.1 to communicate with this hardware on Microsoft Windows. <em>Please have only one of these installed. Installing both will result in failures.</em></p>
				<p>This hardware is known to work with Mac OS X. Typica requires that NI-DAQmx Base 3.6 is installed to use this hardware on Mac OS X.</p>
				<p>National Instruments claims that this hardware will work with Linux, however it may be difficult to make this work with most Linux distributions. There are minor differences in the way NI-DAQmx Base is loaded in Typica on Windows and Mac OS X and Typica may require minor modification to use this hardware on Linux. Confirmation that this works or a patch to make this work would be appreciated.</p>
