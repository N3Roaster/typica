				<h1>Appendix A.5: Hardware Compatibility Notes - DATAQ DI-145</h1>
				<p>At present this hardware is only supported on Microsoft Windows and requires that the DATAQ SDK is installed. It will likely be supported on other platforms in the future, but purchasing hardware based on possible future compatibility is not recommended. Note that this device does not take thermocouple inputs directly and additional hardware may be required to effectively utilize this hardware. While measurements from this device can be mapped to temperature data, there are several characteristics of this device which make it the least desirable of the supported options for that sort of data. This device is better suited to logging control data of limited range and precision.</p>
				
				<p>Some Diedrich roasters have included hardware appropriate for connecting to this device. An example is shown in the following video.</p>
