				<h1>Appendix A.6: Hardware Compatibility Notes - Modbus RTU Devices</h1>
				<p>While Modbus RTU devices are supported on all platforms, these are usually connected through an RS-485 to USB adapter. Please verify driver support for your adapter with platforms you intend to use. There are also several limitations in Typica's support of Modbus RTU devices. While these limitations are likely to be removed soon with a future version of Typica, at present only one device is supported per bus and only one process value and up to one set value per device is available. This is sufficient for basic logging of temperature data and allows limited control in some roasting system designs, but more complex configurations or devices dealing with non-temperature data monitoring and control are not yet supported.</p>
