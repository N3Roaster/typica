				<h1>Supported Platforms and Hardware</h1>
				<p>This section details the hardware and software that Typica
				has been tested with and what is known to work. Other
				arrangements may work but have not been tested.</p>
				
				<h2>Operating Systems</h2>
				<p>Precompiled builds of Typica are provided for Microsoft
				Windows and Mac OS X. The Microsoft Windows build has been
				tested as working on both Windows 7 and Windows 8. It might
				work on Windows XP or Windows Vista but this has not been
				tested.</p>
				<p>The Mac OS X build has been tested on Mac OS X 10.6 and 10.7.
				It might work on 10.4, 10.5, and 10.8 but this has not been
				tested. The build is also only for Macs with Intel processors.</p>
				<p>Source code is provided which may be used to build Typica
				on Linux, PowerPC based Macs, and possibly other platforms,
				however instructions on doing this are beyond the scope of this
				document.</p>

				<h2>Data Acquisition Hardware</h2>
				<p>On Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X, the National Instruments
				NI 9211 module is supported in either the
				<a href="http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/13880">NI USB-9161</a>
				or
				<a href="http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/201881">NI USB-9162</a>
				USB carrier using NI DAQmx Base supporting software which is
				available for download from National Instruments. Note that the
				different USB carriers require different versions of this software.
				Using the 9161 carrier you will need
				<a href="http://joule.ni.com/nidu/cds/view/p/id/428/lang/en">NI-DAQmx Base 2.1 on Mac OS X</a>
				or
				<a href="http://joule.ni.com/nidu/cds/view/p/id/424/lang/en">NI-DAQmx Base 2.2 on Microsoft Windows</a>.
				Using the 9162 carrier, you will need
				<a href="http://joule.ni.com/nidu/cds/view/p/id/3431/lang/en">NI DAQmx Base 3.6 on Mac OS X</a>
				or
				<a href="http://joule.ni.com/nidu/cds/view/p/id/3436/lang/en">NI DAQmx Base 3.6 on Microsoft Windows</a>.
				Please check documentation
				available from National Instruments regarding Linux support if you
				intend to build Typica on Linux.</p>
				<p>On <strong>Microsoft Windows only</strong> the National
				Instruments NI 9211 module can be used with the
				<a href="http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/201881">NI USB-9162</a>
				USB carrier or the
				<a href="http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/209887">NI cDAQ-9171</a>.
				The
				<a href="http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/208177">NI USB-TC01</a>
				is also an option on
				this platform. This has been tested with
				<a href="http://joule.ni.com/nidu/cds/view/p/id/3622/lang/en">NI-DAQmx 9.6.1</a>.
				Note that NI-DAQmx should not be installed at the same time as NI-DAQmx Base 3.6
				however it is fine to have it installed at the same time as NI-DAQmx Base 2.2.</p>
				<p>On all platforms, devices which communicate using the Modbus
				RTU protocol can be used. Currently only one such device is
				supported per bus and measurements must be delivered in scaled
				integer representation. You will need the communications manual
				for whichever device you choose in order to set up Typica. This
				has been tested with the Fuji PXR4 PID controller, but most
				similar devices with Modbus RTU support should also work. Typica
				does not require any supporting software for this hardware,
				however most of these devices use RS-485 for the physical connection
				and you may need an RS-485 to USB adapter and you may need to
				install driver software before this adapter will work correctly.
				Consult the manuals for your hardware for more details.</p>
