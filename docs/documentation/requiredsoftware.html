				<h1>Required Software</h1>
				<p>Typica can benefit from certain supporting software and some
				hardware requires software for communicating with that hardware.</p>
				
				<h2>PostgreSQL</h2>
				<p>Most of the features of Typica use a PostgreSQL database.
				This is where the data on all of the batches of coffee you
				roast will be saved, where inventory data will be saved, and
				it is the source of all data used in reports. While it is
				possible to use Typica without PostgreSQL, the usable feature
				set will be highly limited.</p>
				
				<p>The easiest way to set this up is to install PostgreSQL on
				the same computer that will be running Typica, however there
				are some advantages to running the database on a different
				machine on the network. That requires some additional work to
				set up PostgreSQL to accept connections from other computers on
				your network, but this allows multiple computers to run Typica
				and access the same data.</p>
				
				<p>PostgreSQL can be obtained from
				<a href="http://www.postgresql.org">www.postgresql.org</a>.
				There you can
				<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/download/">download</a> the
				appropriate binary package for the platform you intend to run
				the database on. Typica requires version 9.3 or later, however the people behind PostgreSQL have a very good history of making new versions better than the old one so the newest stable release is recommended for new installations. When installing PostgreSQL, please make note of
				the password that you choose for the postgres user as you will
				need this information later.</p>
				
				<p>If you do want to set up PostgreSQL for use over a network,
				you may find
				<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html">
				this section</a> of the documentation helpful.
				<a href="http://appliedcoffeetechnology.tumblr.com/post/14056767756">
				This blog post</a> may also be useful.</p>
				
				<p>Once you are finished installing and setting up PostgreSQL,
				you may want to restart your computer and verify that the PostgreSQL
				starts on boot.</p>
				
				<h3>Optional: Setting up a Database and User Role</h3>
				
				<p>The PostgreSQL installer will set up a user role called
				<tt>postgres</tt> and a database called <tt>postgres</tt>. The
				<tt>postgres</tt> user has full access to all features of the
				database and Typica does not require that. If you are using
				PostgreSQL for other purposes you may also want to give Typica
				its own database to avoid potential conflicts with other
				applications. Typica will use whatever database and user you
				specify the first time you start the program. Details on how to
				do this are in the
				<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/index.html">
				PostgreSQL documentation</a>.
				
				<p>The following two videos might be helpful. One provides a walkthrough of installing PostgreSQL on either Mac OS X or Windows. The other covers upgrading from an older version of PostgreSQL to a newer one.</p>

				<h2>Hardware Communications Software</h2>
				
				<p>The software that you need to communicate with your data
				acquisition hardware depends on what hardware you intend to use.</p>
				
				<h3>Phidgets 1048</h3>
				
				<p>The Phidgets 1048 requires the <a href="http://www.phidgets.com/docs/Operating_System_Support">drivers and libraries download available from the manufacturer</a>. This is tested as working with Typica on Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux.</p>
				
				<h3>Software for Modbus RTU device support</h3>
				
				<p>No additional software is strictly required for devices that
				communicate using the Modbus RTU protocol. Most of these devices
				are connected with RS-485, which is not a standard you are likely
				to find built into your computer so you will most likely need
				an adapter that allows you to connect the bus to your computer
				through a USB connection. Your computer should see this adapter
				as an ordinary serial port, however you may need to install
				driver software for the adapter you choose. Ensure that the
				adapter is supported on whatever platform you intend to use.</p>
				
				<h3>NI DAQmx Devices - Microsoft Windows Only</h3>
				
				<p>Certain hardware from National Instruments requires
				NI-DAQmx. Typica has been tested with version 9.6.1, however newer hardware revisions of some supported hardware requires a newer version. See
				<a href="platforms.html#hardware">Supported Platforms and Hardware</a>
				for more details.</p>
				
				<h3>NI DAQmx Base Devices</h3>
				
				<p>Certain hardware from National Instruments requires NI-DAQmx Base.
				The version you will need depends on the hardware you have. See
				<a href="platforms.html#hardware">Supported Platforms and Hardware</a>
				for more details.</p>

				<p>You will also need to download Typica to be able to use Typica.</p>
