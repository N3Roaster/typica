                <h1>Connecting to a database</h1>
                <p>When opening Typica, if you have not previously connected to
                a database, you will be prompted for information needed to
                connect to that database.</p>

                <img src="databaseconnection.png"/>
                
                <p>If you do not want to connect to a database, you can click
                the Cancel button, but doing so means that most of the features
                of Typica will not work. Clicking the Connect button will cause
                Typica to attempt to connect to the database with the
                information provided in the fields. An error message will be
                presented if that connection attempt fails.</p>
                
                <p>After either successfully connecting to a database or
                cancelling, you will be prompted to
                <a href="openconfigurationfile.html">open a configuration
                file.</a></p>
                
                <h2>Field descriptions</h2>
                
                <h3>Database driver</h3>
                <p>Currently the only database supported is PostgreSQL.</p>
                
                <h3>Host name</h3>
                <p>This identifies the computer the database is installed on.
                If the database is on the same computer as Typica, this can be
                <tt>localhost</tt> otherwise it will most likely be an IP
                address for another computer on your network.</p>
                
                <h3>Port number</h3>
                <p>PostgreSQL normally communicates on port 5432 but if you
                have PostgreSQL configured to communicate over a different port
                this field should be changed to match.</p>
                
                <h3>Database name</h3>
                <p>During installation, the PostgreSQL installer creates a
                database called <tt>postgres</tt>. If you've created a new
                database for use with Typica, its name should be used.</p>
                
                <h3>User name</h3>
                <p>During installation, the PostgreSQL installer creates a
                database user called <tt>postgres</tt>. If you don't want to
                create separate users, this account can be used. Typica keeps
                track of which database user performed many data entry tasks so
                it is recommended to create new users for everybody who will be
                using Typica.</p>
                
                <h3>Password</h3>
                <p>This is the password previously set for the database user.
                If you are using the <tt>postgres</tt> user, this was set
                during PostgreSQL installation.</p>
