                <h1>The Logging View</h1>
                <p>The appearance of the logging view depends on how the selected
                roaster was configured, but there are a few main areas where
                different interface items are located.</p>

                <img src="logging.png"/>
                
                <p>The window title will change to reflect a loaded target roast
                profile and can provide the name of the coffee being roasted.</p>

                <p>The menu bar provides access to a number of operations such
                as saving or loading data on disk, entering new batch information,
                clearing recorded data, changing how data is displayed, and more.
                Note that on a Mac the menu bar will be at the top of the screen
                and not within the window as is normal on that platform.</p>

                <p>Continuing down the window is the indicator panel. This is
                where current temperature indicators, rate of change information,
                and timers will be displayed. The number, type, and order of
                indicators depends on the roaster configuration. There are
                splitter handles between each indicator which can be used to
                control the width of each indicator. The last indicator should
                always be the batch timer. If you don't see this, there should
                be a splitter handle to the right of the last visible indicator
                which can be dragged left to reveal additional indicators. A
                splitter handle at the bottom can be used to control the height
                of all indicators.</p>

                <p>Next is a row of buttons. At minimum this will include buttons
                for starting and stopping the batch, but a number of other
                controls for inserting notes in the log can also be configured
                to appear here. Under these buttons is another splitter handle
                that can be used to control the height of to table and graph
                below.</p>

                <p>Below this and on the left is a table view showing times,
                temperatures, and notes for both a target profile if one is
                loaded and the current batch if one is being recorded.</p>

                <p>To the right of the table view is a graph showing both
                loaded target profiles, if any, and current batch data.</p>

                <h2>Buttons</h2>

                <h3>Start Batch</h3>
                <p>This button starts recording roasting data. If the New Batch
                or New Sample Batch windows were used, the roasting data can be
                associated with a batch in the database. Clicking this will
                also start the batch timer from 00:00, start any other timers
                that have been configured to start from the start of the batch,
                and create any annotations that have been configured for entry
                at the start of the batch if any.</p>

                <h3>Stop Batch</h3>
                <p>This button stops the batch timer, stops recording roasting
                data, and if the New Batch or New Sample Batch windows were
                used, the window with data associated with the finished batch
                will be raised.</p>

                <h3>Additional Buttons</h3>
                <p>Additional buttons and controls will appear if these have
                been configured.</p>

                <h2>The File Menu</h2>

                <img src="loggingfile.png" />

                <h3>Open...</h3>
                <p>This can be used to load roasting data previously saved to
                disk. This is mainly useful when receiving roasting data that
                has been shared from another roaster. In normal use it is much
                better to use information saved to the database instead of
                managing files manually.</p>

                <h3>Save...</h3>
                <p>This can be used to save roasting data to disk. This is
                mainly useful to share roasting data with another person using
                Typica. For other uses it is much better to use the New Batch
                and New Sample Batch windows to have roasting data saved to the
                database.</p>

                <h3>Print...</h3>
                <p>This can be used to print roasting data. The print window
                will appear, allowing the information printed to be
                customized.</p>

                <h3>Export CSV...</h3>
                <p>This can be used to export roasting data as a CSV file which
                can be opened in all popular spreadsheet applications or used
                with a wide variety of other tools. If this is something that
                you frequently require, it may be a good idea to reach out to
                the author with your use case and see if there is a way to do
                what you want within Typica or if Typica should be extended to
                support your use case.</p>

                <h3>Export XHTML+SVG</h3>
                <p>This can be used to produce the same information that can be
                printed, but produces that as an XHTML+SVG document.</p>

                <h3>Quit</h3>
                <p>On some platforms this might be called Exit and on the Mac
                this will be moved under the Typica menu. It is used to quit
                Typica.</p>
                
                <h2>The Batch Menu</h2>
                
                <img src="loggingbatch.png" />
                
                <h3>New Batch...</h3>
                <p>This is the preferred way to enter the details of a
                production roast such that recorded roasting data can be
                associated with a batch and green coffee inventory can be
                adjusted. Selecting this will open the New Batch window.</p>
                
                <h3>New Sample Batch...</h3>
                <p>When roasting a green coffee not in inventory such as
                pre-purchase samples, you can use this menu item to open the
                New Sample Batch window and associate the roasting data with
                additional information about the coffee.</p>
                
                <h3>Load Additional Profiles...</h3>
                <p>If you do not have a target roast profile for the roasted
                coffee item you are producing but have a batch that you would
                like to have available for reference previously saved in the
                database, you can use this menu item to load that information
                as a target roast profile.</p>
                
                <h2>The Log Menu</h2>
                
                <img src="logginglog.png" />
                
                <h3>Display Celsius</h3>
                <p>This menu item can be used to change displayed temperature
                measurements to Celsius.</p>
                
                <h3>Display Fahrenheit</h3>
                <p>This menu item can be used to change displayed temperature
                measurements to Fahrenheit.</p>
                
                <h3>New Sample Parameters</h3>
                <p>If a Counting Button has been configured, this menu item
                will be available to change the annotation text or reset the
                number used in annotations when that button is activated.</p>
                
                <h3>Clear Log</h3>
                <p>This menu item removes all information currently visible in
                the table and graph views.</p>
                
                <h3>Millisecond View</h3>
                <h3>1 Second View</h3>
                <h3>5 Second View</h3>
                <h3>10 Second View</h3>
                <h3>15 Second View</h3>
                <h3>30 Second View</h3>
                <h3>1 Minute View</h3>
                
                <p>These items affect the table view. The millisecond view will
                show every measurement in the table while the other views will
                limit the entries shown to one per indicated interval with the
                exception of times associated with an annotation which will
                always be shown regardless of the selected view.</p>
                
                <h3>Manual Entry</h3>
                <p>This can be used for entering roasting data collected when
                not connected to a roaster. The utility of this feature is
                somewhat limited and generally not worth using.</p>
                
                <h2> The Graph Menu</h2>
                
                <img src="logginggraph.png" />
                
                <h3>Reset Translation</h3>
                <p>If the roaster in use has been configured to use roast
                profile translation, this item can be used to reset any
                currently applied translation transformation in the graph.</p>
