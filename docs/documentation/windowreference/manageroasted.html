                <p>When using the New Batch window to roast coffee, there is a
                control to select which roasted coffee item you would like to
                roast. Manage Roasted Coffee Items allows you to control which
                items will appear in that list.</p>
                
                <h2>Field descriptions</h2>
                
                <h3>New Roasted Coffee</h3>
                <p>If you want a completely new roasted coffee item, you can
                type the name of the item in this field, click Add New Coffee,
                and this will create a new roasted coffee item and add it to
                the Current Items list.</p>
                
                <h3>Current Items</h3>
                <p>This is a list of all of the items that will appear in the
                New Batch window. If you discontinue a roasted coffee item and
                would like that to no longer appear as an option in the New
                Batch window you can select the item and click Remove Item to
                move that item to the Discontinued Items list.</p>
                
                <h3>Discontinued Items</h3>
                <p>This is a list of roasted coffee items which are not in the
                Current Items list. If you have previously discontinued an item
                and would like to bring that back as an option in the New Batch
                window, you can select the item from this list and click Restore
                Item.</p>
