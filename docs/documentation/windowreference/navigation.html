                <p>Most of the functionality in Typica is available through the
                main navigation window.</p>

                <h2>Buttons</h2>
                
                <h3>Configure Roasters</h3>
                
                <p>Typica can communicate with different pieces of data
                acquisition hardware which must be configured before use.
                Various features related to recording roasting data can be
                set in the configuration
                window.
                
                <h3>Roast Coffee</h3>
                
                <p>Once at least one coffee roaster has been configured, it
                will be available from the selector next to the Roast Coffee
                button. When you want to roast coffee, select the machine
                you'll be using and click the Roast Coffee button. This will
                take you to <a href="logging.html">the logging view.</a></p>
                
                <h3>Purchase Green Coffee</h3>
                
                <p>Typica tracks green coffee inventory. This button allows
                you to enter the details of green coffee purchases.</p>
                
                <h3>Manage Roasted Coffee Items</h3>
                
                <p>When entering the details of a new production batch, you
                will want to select a roasted coffee item. This is connected
                to the green coffee(s) used, a target roast profile and
                roasting specification if set. This button allows you to create
                new roasted coffee items, discontinue items so that they will
                not show up in lists, and bring back old items.</p>
                
                <h3>Edit Roasting Specification</h3>
                
                <p>Expected percent weight loss and other information can be
                presented when roasting coffee for use in determining if a
                batch matches its product specification.</p>
                
                <h3>Update Inventory</h3>
                
                <p>Inventory and loss transactions can be used to adjust
                green coffee inventory.</p>

                <h3>Summarize Cupping Session</h3>
                
                <p>Typica includes a set of cupping features. Some people use
                this, but the author does not recommend it. Something much
                better will be available in the future.</p>
                
                <h3>View Target Roast Profiles</h3>
                
                <p>Any data ever saved as a target roast profile for roasted
                coffee items can be seen here.</p>
                
                <h3>Import Target Roast Profiles</h3>
                
                <p>It is possible to save batch data to disk instead of or in
                addition to saving that to the database. These files can be
                shared with other people using Typica. If you want to set data
                from one of these files as a target roast profile for a given
                roasted coffee item, this is where you do that.
                
                <h3>Enter Green Coffee Sales</h3>
                
                <p>If you sell green coffee, the inventory can be adjusted to
                reflect that here.</p>
