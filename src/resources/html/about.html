				<h3>Special Thanks</h3>
				<p>Ongoing development of Typica is made possible through the
				generous financial contributions from the following:</p>

				<p>Anonymous Funders Through
				<a href="https://www.gittip.com/N3Roaster/">Gittip</a></p>

				<h3>Get Involved</h3>
				<p>Typica has reached a point in its development where it can
				be considered mature with a feature set appropriate for many
				coffee roasting firms. There is, however, considerable variety
				among roasting firms in the equipment used, roasting styles,
				process traceability requirements, languages understood, and
				other preferences. There is also still considerable room for
				improvement in many areas. The development of Typica has been
				on a budget of approximately $0, but software development is
				not without cost. This is especially the case for cross
				platform development of software that interfaces with external
				hardware. These are some of the things that could be done with
				additional funding:
					<ul>
						<li>Improve development and testing infrastructure.
						This would allow more complete testing of release
						candidates on all platforms and greatly increase the
						quality and speed at which new releases could be made
						available.</li>
						<li>Purchase additional measurement devices. Interest
						has been expressed in using many types of hardware not
						currently supported in Typica. Some of these
						suggestions are quite reasonable and the only reason I
						am not able to include support for them is simply that
						I do not have a sample of the hardware to test my code
						against.</li>
						<li>Pay for web hosting. While the Internet allows
						free software to be distributed cheaply, this is not
						without cost.</li>
						<li>Allow more development time. As of this writing,
						nobody has contributed any improvements to Typica's
						program code. This has all been designed and written
						by a single person working on it as time is available.
						Many of the planned improvements require nothing beyond
						time to plan an implementation, to write the program
						code, to integrate it with the rest of the program, and
						to test that the feature is sound. With sufficient
						sustained funding it would be possible to devote more
						time to continuing development, resulting in a more
						rapid release of features and other improvements to
						Typica.</li>

				payable in US dollars preferred) to:</p>

				<p>All who contribute in this way will be thanked in the
				Special Thanks section seen above in the next public release,
				so please indicate if you would like to be identified by your
				name, your company name, or in some other way.</p>
				<p>Anonymous funding can also be made through
				<a href="https://www.gittip.com/N3Roaster/">Gittip</a>. While
				it is not possible to verify and recognize those who help
				provide funding in this way, the small weekly payments are
				easier to plan around than larger one time contributions.</p>
