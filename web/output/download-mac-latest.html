<h2>Please Help Support Ongoing Development</h2>
<p>While Typica is free and will continue to be made freely
available complete with all source code, there are still costs
associated with ongoing development and keeping the software
available. Some of the costs include:
	<ul>
		<li>Obtaining and maintaining hardware appropriate for
		building and testing new releases</li>
		<li>Building and maintaining test rigs for various
		types of data acquisition hardware</li>
		<li>Maintaining the ability to test on new operating
		system releases</li>
		<li>Hosting service</li>
	</ul>
There is also a huge commitment of time in developing, testing,
and supporting this.</p>
<p>While Typica is for many uses a mature and reliable program,
there are still a number of areas where the program can be
improved and additional areas where I think it makes a lot of
sense to extend the program. The limited funding for this work
does slow progress. If you're finding this software to be useful
in your business, if you've had a good support experience, or if
you'd like to help me continue to develop this software, please
consider providing some financial support. Checks can be sent to:
<p>Neal Wilson<br />
c/o Wilson's Coffee &amp; Tea<br />
3306 Washington Ave.<br />
Racine, WI 53405<br />
USA</p>
<p>or you can visit my <a href="http://youtube.com/users/N3Roaster">YouTube
channel</a> and click the blue Support button on the right.</p>
<p>Another great way to help Typica right now is to reach out
to your professional colleagues and let them know that you're
using Typica and what you like about it.</p>
