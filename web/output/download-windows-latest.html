<h2>Please Help Support Ongoing Development</h2>
<p>This will likely be one of the last releases in the 1.x
series. Typica 1.0 was released in 2007 and I've learned a
lot from developing this, using it, and having conversations
with others about how they're using this. While there is the
possibility of further improvements, I believe Typica has
reached a point of maturity with a feature set appropriate for
many coffee roasting firms.</p>
<p>There is a large set of features and extensions that I have
avoided implementing because the changes would have been too
intrusive for the code base as it currently exists, but that
feature set has become too compelling for me to leave undone.
I am, therefore, attempting to spend as much time as I can on
the development of Typica 2.0. This removes many of the legacy
considerations and modernizes the tools and techniques used. I
hope that the result is a better and more broadly useful Typica
that can be maintained for another several years.</p>
<p>While Typica is free and will continue to be made freely
available complete with all source code, there are still costs
associated with ongoing development and keeping the software
available. Some of the costs include:
	<ul>
		<li>Obtaining and maintaining hardware appropriate for
		building and testing new releases</li>
		<li>Building and maintaining test rigs for various
		types of data acquisition hardware</li>
		<li>Maintaining the ability to test on new operating
		system releases</li>
		<li>Hosting service</li>
	</ul>
There is also a huge commitment of time in developing, testing,
and supporting this.</p>
<p>Financial support to date does not come close to covering
these costs, nor has it been enough that I could consider
hiring people to improve the pace and quality of ongoing
development. This is fine. I have no intention of halting work
on the project as my work has benefitted greatly from having
this software and I expect even greater benefit from the next
major release. Personally I find the new feature set exciting
to work on and am willing to cover funding shortfalls when I
can afford to do so.</p>
<p>That said, if you're finding this software to be useful in
your business, if you've had a good support experience, or if
you'd like to help me continue to develop this software, please
consider providing some financial support to:</p>

<p>Another great way to help Typica right now is to reach out
to your professional colleagues and let them know that you're
using Typica and what you like about it.</p>
