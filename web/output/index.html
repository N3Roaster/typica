<p>Typica is a cross-platform application for coffee roasters
with features for recording your roasts, tracking green coffee
inventory, product development, improving production consistency,
and more.</p>
<p>The program is free open source software available under the
MIT license.</p>
<h1>Typica 1.6.4 Now Available</h1>
<p>The latest release of Typica includes bug fixes and minor
feature updates. The most significant new feature is the
ability to use three new types of timer in addition to the
familiar batch timer. See the documentation for details on how to
configure these or watch this new video describing each of the
new timer types and why you might want to use them.</p>

<h1>Data Acquisition</h1>
<p>Every batch of coffee you roast with Typica can be recorded for
future reference. A practically unlimited number of target roast
profiles can be created for reference against future roasts. Log
annotations capture events of interest and aid in profile design.
Compatable with several different data acquisition devices.</p>
<h1>Inventory Tracking</h1>
<p>Keep track of your green coffee inventory automatically as you
roast it. Reports provide the data you need to see your production
trends and plan your green coffee purchases.</p>
<h1>Your Data Your Way</h1>
<p>Typica stores its data in a PostgreSQL database. The database
can be set up on the computer running Typica or on another computer
on the network. You keep full control of your data and never need
to pay another company for continued access to your data. The use
of PostgreSQL provides additional ways to gain insight from your
data including integration with all major spreadsheet applications
through the PostgreSQL ODBC or JDBC drivers.</p>
<h1>Total Customizability</h1>
<p>Typica provides a versatile configuration system which can be
used to extend or modify Typica for better integration with your
work flows. If this is inadequate for your customization needs, the
fully documented C++ source code is also freely available. An
example configuration is provided which aims to provide something
that most will not need to modify, but the option is always there
if you need it.</p>
